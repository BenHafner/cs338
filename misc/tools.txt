QUESTION 3

nslookup also works in reverse. You can type nslookup followed by an IP 
address and it will tell you the host name.

QUESTION 4

I was able to transfer the contents of a file called “test.txt” from my 
virtual Kali desktop to a file called “output_file” on my normal desktop by 
using the command “nc -l 1234 > output_file” on my normal computer and 
“nc 10.133.22.248 1234 < test” on Kali.

I think scp can also work to copy a file to a host without having to run a
command on the host.

QUESTION 6

nc -z -w 1 www.google.com 1-100 (This worked on the Kali terminal scan all 
the ports from 1 to 100 waiting one second to try to connect to each, but it 
didn't work on my normal terminal, and I don’t know why…)
