===== DAYTIME =====

QUESTION 1

The TCP 3-step handshake:

Frame  Source IP       Destination IP  Protocol  Length  Info
1      172.16.227.129  129.6.15.28     TCP       74      59284 -> 13 [SYN]
2      129.6.15.28     172.16.227.129  TCP       60      13 -> 59284 [SYN, ACK]
3      172.16.227.129  129.6.15.28     TCP       54      59284 -> 13 [ACK]

QUESTION 2

My nc client port for this interaction was 59284. The client port is important
because there may be other software programs running on my computer that also
want to use WiFi but my computer only has one IP address for WiFi. So each 
software program gets its own port to do its own thing.

QUESTION 3

Frame  Source IP       Destination IP  Protocol  Length  Info
4      129.6.15.28     172.16.227.129  DAYTIME   105     current date and time

QUESTION 4

59673 22-04-04 03:26:13 50 0 0 237.2 UTC(NIST) *

Here's what all that means:

59673     "Modified Julian Day"
22-04-04  date
03:26:13  time
50        means we are in daylight savings time
0         means there is no leap second coming up
0         means the server is "healthy"
237.2     server's attempt to compensate for internet travel time (milliseconds)
UTC(NIST) time zone
*         for compatibility with the ACTS format

QUESTION 5

A [SYN] packet says what sequence number the current packet is so that the 
two programs can synch up.

QUESTION 6

[ACK] is just an acknowledgment like "roger that."

QUESTION 7

[FIN] is the packet you send to terminate the connection.

QUESTION 8

Here's what happened at the end of my connection to the server:

Frame  Source IP       Destination IP  Protocol  Length  Info
5      172.16.227.129  129.6.15.28     TCP       54      59284 -> 13 [FIN, ACK]
6      129.6.15.28     172.16.227.129  TCP       60      13 -> 59284 [ACK]

In frame 5, my nc client acknowledged the DAYTIME packet and asked to terminate
the connection. In frame 6, the NIST server acknowledged my packet and then
stopped talking.

===== HTTP =====

QUESTION 1

It looks like Firefox opened two TCP connections, one from port 38738 and one
from port 38740.

QUESTION 2

Frame  Source IP       Destination IP  Protocol  Length  Info
7      172.16.227.129  45.79.89.123    HTTP      395     GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

QUESTION 3

Frame  Source IP       Destination IP  Protocol  Length  Info
11     172.16.227.129  45.79.89.123    HTTP      364     GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====

What are the [PSH] packets?

Why did Firefox request favicon.ico and is that why there was a 404 Not Found
error?

Wireshark color codes the frames/packets, but I don't know what the colors mean.
