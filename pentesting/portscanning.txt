Host Detection & Port Scanning

===== 1. Passive Information Gathering =====

I looked at the domain wikipedia.org. According to the nslookup command I ran, 
wikipedia's IP address is 208.80.153.224. I also ran the whois command to learn 
more about wikipedia. I found that its domain registration was first established 
in 2001 and will expire in 2023 if they don't renew it before then. I learned 
that the company that registered the wikipedia.org domain is called Wikimedia 
Foundation, Inc., located at 1 Montgomery Street, Suite 1600, San Fransisco, CA, 
and also several names, emails, and phone numbers of people in charge of 
Wikipedia's servers.

There's a bunch more info about on the Netcraft site report for Wikipedia.

===== 2. Host Detection =====

These are the four active IP addresses on Kali's local network that start with 
172.16.227:
     172.16.227.1
     172.16.227.2
     172.16.227.129
     172.16.227.130
I know 172.16.227.129 is Kali's address and 172.16.227.130 is Metasploitable's 
address. I think 172.16.227.1 is the "bridge" from the virtual network where 
Kali and Metasploitable live to my actual local network. I'm not sure what 
172.16.227.2 is.

Since this is my local network, nmap found these IP addresses by sending out ARP 
requests to all 256 addresses starting with 172.16.227.

Next I scanned a remote network--the Carleton Math/CS network. I used nmap to 
scan all IP addresses starting with 137.22.4 and found that 77 of those 256 
addresses were active. These 77 IP addresses appear to correspond to physical 
computers in the Math and CS departments' offices and classrooms. Maybe they are 
all plugged into the same local Ethernet network?

Since this was a remote network, nmap sent out TPC SNY packets instead of ARP 
requests to figure out  which IP addresses were active.

===== 3. Port Scanning =====

I scanned all four of the addresses I found on Kali's local network, but none of 
them had any ports open except Metasploitable, which had a bunch of ports open. 
Here's nmap's table of Metasploitable's open ports and the services they 
correspond to:

PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
23/tcp   open  telnet
25/tcp   open  smtp
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
512/tcp  open  exec
513/tcp  open  login
514/tcp  open  shell
1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
1524/tcp open  ingreslock
2049/tcp open  nfs
2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
3306/tcp open  mysql
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5900/tcp open  vnc
6000/tcp open  X11
6667/tcp open  irc
8009/tcp open  ajp13
8180/tcp open  unknown

I think port 3306 and 5432, which are labeled "mysql" and "postgresql", are 
databases services.

By running nmap with the -A flag, I got more info about these ports, and was 
able to see the public RSA key associated with port 22, which is for ssh. The 
value of the key, in hexadecimal, is 
56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3. If I were to try to ssh into 
Metasploitable, I think I would have to encrypt using that public key.

To be honest, I really don't know what almost any of these ports are for, but I 
do know that port 25 is for email. It's labeled "smtp" in nmap's table, which 
stands for "simple mail transfer protocol". Originally established by RFC 821 
way back in 1982, it's is a pretty straightforward test-based protocol, kind of 
like HTTP but a little less versatile. It was originally an unencrypted 
protocol, but was updated to provide an option for TLS encryption.
